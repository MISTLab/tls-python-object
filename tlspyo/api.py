        ``tlspyo`` Relay.

        Endpoints connect to a central Relay, which allows them to communicate in `tlspyo`.
        When used on the Internet, the machine running the Relay must be directly visible from the Internet.
        (Usually, if the machine is behind an Internet box/router, this involves port forwarding.)
        WHEN USING `tlspyo` ON THE INTERNET, IT IS IMPORTANT TO USE TLS SECURITY (default).
        In particular, you will want to choose a strong password, and use your own TLS credentials.
        See the Command Line Interface section of the documentation to generate your TLS credentials.

                If None, the Relay accepts any group;
                Else, must be a dictionary where keys are groups and values are dictionaries with the following entries:

                    - 'max_count': max number of connected clients in the group (None for unlimited)
                    - 'max_consumables': max number of pending consumables in the group (None for unlimited)

            local_com_port (int): local port used for internal communication with Twisted.
