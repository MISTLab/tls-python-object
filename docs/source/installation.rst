Installation
============

``tlspyo`` can be installed with pip:

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install tlspyo

Note that, since ``tlspyo`` is using the ``pickle`` serializer by default, you probably want all your machines to run the same python version unless you implement your own serializer.

Once ``tlspyo`` is successfully installed, you usually need to generate TLS credentials from the CLI.
